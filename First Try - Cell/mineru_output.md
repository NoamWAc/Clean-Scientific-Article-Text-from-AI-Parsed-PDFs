# SUMMARY

The ATP- dependent ring- shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT is essential for cellular proteostasis. To uncover why some eukaryotic proteins can only fold with TRiC assistance, we reconstituted the folding of  $\beta$ - tubulin using human prefoldin and TRiC. We find unstructured  $\beta$ - tubulin is delivered by prefoldin to the open TRiC chamber followed by ATP- dependent chamber closure. Cryo- EM resolves four near- atomic- resolution structures containing progressively folded  $\beta$ - tubulin intermediates within the closed TRiC chamber, culminating in native tubulin. This substrate folding pathway appears closely guided by site- specific interactions with conserved regions in the TRiC chamber. Initial electrostatic interactions between the TRiC interior wall and both the folded tubulin N domain and its C- terminal E- hook tail establish the native substrate topology, thus enabling C- domain folding. Intrinsically disordered CCT C termini within the chamber promote subsequent folding of tubulin's core and middle domains and GTP- binding. Thus, TRiC's chamber provides chemical and topological directives that shape the folding landscape of its obligate substrates.

# INTRODUCTION

How proteins fold in vivo is a central question in biology, highly relevant to human health, as many diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration are linked to protein misfolding.1- 5 Several classes of molecular chaperones play central roles in the folding of newly translated polypeptides.6- 8 While some chaperones, such as NAC or Hsp70 facilitate folding of a wide range of proteins, others, such as the ring- shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT facilitate folding of a subset of proteins comprising  $\sim 10\%$  of the eukaryotic proteome.9 The proteins that require TRiC for folding, many of them essential for viability, are distinguished by their aggregation propensity and topological complexity.9,10 In vivo, TRiC functions in cooperation with upstream chaperones, including Hsp70 and prefoldin (PFD, also called GIMc). Prefoldin binds directly to TRiC through an electrostatic pivot, suggesting a direct mechanism of substrate transfer.11

How TRiC/CCT assists folding is intriguing because several eukaryotic proteins can only fold with the assistance of TRiC. These proteins cannot fold either spontaneously nor with any other chaperone, under any known condition.12,13 An explanation for this obligate requirement is lacking. An intriguing hypoth esis is that the information present in their amino acid sequence does not suffice to reach the native state. In this hypothesis, TRiC may contribute the chemical and topological environment necessary to guide their folding, suggesting a co- evolution between TRiC and some eukaryotic proteins.

TRiC is a  $\sim 1$  MDa chaperonin, consisting of two identical rings stacked back to back.14 Unlike bacterial or archaeal chaperonins, each TRiC ring is assembled from eight different subunits, called CCT1- CCT8, in an evolutionarily conserved arrangement.15 Access to the central chamber of each ring is regulated in an ATP- dependent manner by a built- in lid, formed by flexible loops protruding from each subunit. The lid is open in the unliganded apo- state of TRiC, allowing substrates to bind through subunit- specific contacts in the apical domains.12,16 ATP hydrolysis leads to lid closure, encapsulating the substrate within the central chamber, where folding occurs.17,18

The hetero- oligomeric nature of TRiC is likely key to its unique ability to fold obligate substrates. Subunit divergence likely contributes to the folding process in various ways. The specific subunit arrangement segregates substrate and ATP binding properties within the ring and produces an asymmetric charge

distribution within the closed chamber.15,18 Unfolded substrates such as actin, AML, or VHL bind open TRiC through subunit- specific contacts with CCT apical domains.12,19- 21 This could bias the initial topology of the TRiC- bound substrate to a conformation that is productive for folding. Analysis of TRiC- mediated actin folding indicates that the gradient of ATP affinities within the ring promotes stepwise release during chamber closure to facilitate folding.12,18 However, how folding occurs inside the closed TRiC folding chamber is not understood. Is the bound substrate released into the ATP- closed chaperonin chamber, as shown for bacterial chaperonin GroEL- ES? How do the properties of the TRiC chamber affect the folding pathway of its substrates?

To address these questions, we reconstituted and analyzed the prefoldin- TRiC- mediated folding pathway of the archetype TRiC obligate substrates,  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  - tubulin. Prefoldin maintains tubulin in a highly unstructured state and directly transfers substrate into the TRiC chamber. ATP addition then leads to lid closure and tubulin encapsulation and folding within the closed TRiC chamber. Biochemical and cryoelectron microscopy cryo- EM) structural analyses of the chaperone- mediated folding reaction reveal highly specific substrate contacts with the inner chamber of TRiC. These electrostatic and polar tubulin contacts with individual CCT subunits direct the tubulin folding trajectory by promoting domain- wise formation of four progressively folded intermediates culminating in the native state.

# RESULTS

# Reconstituting the human prefoldin-TRiC pathway for efficient tubulin folding

$\alpha$  or  $\beta$  - tubulin monomers are folded in vivo by a chaperone pathway consisting of prefoldin and TRiC/CCT22,23 and subsequently steered into tubulin dimers by a complex network of poorly understood assembly factors.24,25 We reconstituted the prefoldin- TRiC- tubulin monomer folding pathway using purified human components (Figures 1A and S1A, B). Folding reactions were performed starting from prefoldin- bound  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  - tubulin complexes (Figure S1C) that were incubated with purified human TRiC in the presence and absence of ATP. Folding reactions were analyzed using native PAGE (N- PAGE) to assess formation of tubulin chaperone complexes during the folding reaction while limited- proteolysis assays followed by gel electrophoresis (LIP- PAGE) were used to examine the conformation of chaperone- bound tubulin (Figures 1B and 1C). N- PAGE revealed that TRiC addition to prefoldin:  $\alpha$  - tubulin or prefoldin:  $\beta$  - tubulin complexes led to formation of a ternary complex with TRiC, reflected in a characteristic mobility shift (Figure 1B for  $\beta$  - tubulin and S1D for  $\alpha$  - tubulin).11 Subsequent ATP addition led to production of folded protease- resistant tubulin monomer (Figure 1C; note GTP is added to stabilize folded tubulin). To further assess whether TRiC promotes ATP- dependent tubulin folding, we incubated these reactions with two factors known to bind to either  $\alpha$  or  $\beta$  - tubulin monomers, called TBCB and TBCA,

respectively.22- 25 N- PAGE revealed that, in the presence of ATP, TRiC yielded tubulin competent to form a characteristic complex with these monomer- binding factors (Figure 1B and S1D).

respectively. $^{22 - 25}$  N- PAGE revealed that, in the presence of ATP, TRiC yielded tubulin competent to form a characteristic complex with these monomer- binding factors (Figure 1B and S1D).Susceptibility to low concentrations of non- specific protease proteinase K (PK) is a hallmark of unstructured polypeptides, while folded domains tend to exhibit enhanced PK resistance. $^{26,27}$  We used LIP- PAGE with PK to characterize the conformation of  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulin folding intermediates along the prefoldin:TRiC chaperone pathway (LIP- PAGE, Figures 1C and S1E). Similar results were obtained for  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulins, suggesting a shared mechanism of chaperone action for these proteins (Figures S1D and S1E). As expected, folded tubulin in  $\alpha /\beta$  dimers is nearly fully PK resistant, except for some degradation of flexible C- terminal tails. In contrast, both  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulin bound to prefoldin were highly PK sensitive, indicating the bound substrate adopts an unstructured protease- sensitive conformation. Addition of TRiC and ensuing formation of a ternary prefoldin:tubulin:TRiC complex led to enhanced  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulin protection against PK, suggesting tubulin becomes compacted upon binding to TRiC. We reached similar conclusions using an antibody directed against the N- terminal domain of tubulin or one directed against the C terminus of tubulin (Figures S1G- S1I). Interestingly, probing with the N- terminal- directed antibody but not the C- terminal- directed antibody also detected smaller protected protease fragments, suggesting TRiC promoted formation of partially folded N- terminal domain structures. We next incubated the prefoldin:tubulin:TRiC complex with ATP, which promotes TRiC chamber closure and prefoldin dissociation. $^{11}$  ATP incubation led to formation of full- length protease- protected tubulin, with a similar level of protection as that observed for folded  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulins in the native dimer. Since, in the presence of ATP, the TRiC lid alternates between open and closed states, we examined whether the increased protease protection was due to tubulin folding or to obstruction by the closed lid. First, we extended the time course of PK incubation to 16 min, which should give ample time to PK to access the substrate during the open states. $^{28,29}$  Second, TRiC- tubulin was incubated with ATP to promote folding, followed by subsequent addition of apyrase for 30 or 90 min to hydrolyze all ATP, causing the TRiC lid to reopen. $^{11}$  Under these conditions, tubulin remained fully protease protected, confirming the ATP- induced protease protection arises from tubulin reaching the folded conformation (Figures S1G and S1I).
To confirm the TRiC dependence of  $\beta$ - tubulin folding, we incubated prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin with archaeal M. manpalaudis chaperonin, Mm- Cpn. $^{29}$  Despite its structural and mechanistic similarity To confirm the TRiC dependence of  $\beta$  - tubulin folding, we incubated prefoldin:  $\beta$  - tubulin with archaeal M. manpalaudis chaperonin, Mm- Cpn.29 Despite its structural and mechanistic similarity to TRiC,29 incubating the tubulin- Mm- Cpn complex with ATP/ GTP does not yield PK protection for tubulin but instead produces a digestion pattern similar to that of prefoldin:  $\beta$  - tubulin alone (Figure 1E). This experiment indicates tubulin cannot fold when encapsulated by a non- TRiC group in chaperonin. It also confirmed tubulin protease protection does not derive from a lack of PK accessibility upon substrate enclosure in a folding chamber. These experiments suggest prefoldin and TRiC differentially affect the conformation of the substrate polypeptide during ATP- dependent tubulin folding (Figure 1D). Prefoldin maintains tubulin in a protease- sensitive unstructured state, with no obvious protease- protected fragments observed. Upon prefoldin transfer to TRiC, tubulin becomes compacted, acquiring some protease resistance, including formation of N- terminal domain structures. Finally, ATP- driven encapsulation leads to a fully protease- resistant tubulin that can bind to tubulin monomer binding factors. Since locking the TRiC chamber into a closed conformation by the addition of ATP- AlFx also led to strong protection from proteolysis, we conclude the substrate is fully encapsulated within the central chamber.

We next examined folding when tubulin is directly bound to TRiC and the prefoldin- delivery step is bypassed (Figure 1E). The LIP- PAGE assay indicated tubulin adopts the same compact intermediate upon TRiC binding, regardless of whether tubulin is copurified with TRiC or delivered via prefoldin; furthermore, ATP/GTP addition to TRiC- tubulin also yielded a fully protease- protected conformation (Figure 1E). Thus, TRiC is primarily responsible for tubulin folding, while prefoldin functions to maintain tubulin in an unstructured state, likely to prevent formation of off- pathway trapped intermediates. We set out to study each stage of the reconstituted prefoldin:TRiC- mediated tubulin folding pathway using a hybrid structural and biochemical approach (Figure 1D).

# Defining prefoldin interactions with non-native tubulin

Defining prefoldin interactions with non- native tubulinPrefoldin is a jellyfish- shaped complex with six different subunits forming a double  $\beta$  sheet barrel from which coiled coils extend, forming "tentacles" (Figure 2A). The flexible nature and relatively small size of prefoldin:tubulin hinders its structural characterization by cryo- EM. Accordingly, we mapped the prefoldin:tubulin contacts using crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL- MS), with similar results obtained for  $\alpha$ - and  $\beta$ - tubulins (Figure 2A, 2B, and S2A). Substrate crosslinks (XL) mapped primarily to the coiled- coil tentacles and the terminal disordered tails of prefoldin, indicating non- native tubulin binds inside the prefoldin "chamber" (Figures 2B and S2B). Structural mapping of the

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/9235d407-7ed2-4717-8282-34d61442e867/aef2f4b6bf2427a6da1f156ff4290ea10d921fe038aa3279025b2c3d0d2370c6.jpg)

prefoldin:tubulin XL contact information suggests substrate binds prefoldin through highly heterogeneous interactions within the chamber (Figures 2C and 2D). The N- terminal domain of tubulin made numerous contacts throughout the prefoldin inner chamber, with most XL mapping to contiguous prefoldin 1/5/6 coiled coils. In contrast, the tubulin core domain was crosslinked primarily to one specific region in prefoldin 6. The C- terminal domain of tubulin also crosslinked to a continuous patch on prefoldin 3/5/6, while the M- domain crosslinked to several points at the bottom of the prefoldin chamber. These analyses, together with the high protease sensitivity of prefoldin- bound tubulin, suggest tubulin populates a highly dynamic conformational ensemble, even though some regions of tubulin bind more stably to specific regions within the prefoldin chamber.

Prefoldin is an ATP- independent chaperone, raising the question of how substrate binding and release are regulated. Surprisingly, while binding either  $\alpha$ - or  $\beta$ - tubulin to prefoldin adds an additional molecular mass of  $\sim 50$  kDa to the 101 kDa prefoldin complex, the prefoldin- substrate complexes migrated faster on N- PAGE than prefoldin alone (Figure 2E). We hypothesized substrate binding to prefoldin induces a conformational compaction. Native mass spectrometry analyses support this idea (Figures 2F, 2G, S2C, and S2D). Prefoldin alone produced a bimodal charge distribution for the single expected prefoldin mass (101 kDa) (Figures S2C and S2D). Because the charge states produced during gentle ionization are strongly dependent on the exposed surface area,30- 33 these data indicate pure prefoldin adopts two distinct structural states: one more compact and one more extended. Analysis of prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin complexes by native mass spectrometry also yielded a bimodal charge series consistent with the expected mass of the binary prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin complex (151 kDa) (Figures 2F and S2E). Of note, the relative intensity, and therefore abundance, of the compact species was higher in prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin peaks compared to prefoldin peaks (Figures 2E- 2G and S2E). The conclusion that tubulin binding induces a shift to the more compact prefoldin conformation supports the N- PAGE analyses as well as our finding of extensive XL between tubulin and the tentacles of PFD2 and PFD6, located at opposite sides of the prefoldin chamber. A possible function for this compaction arises from cryo- EM structural analyses of the prefoldin- TRiC interaction, which found a flexible contact point between the base of prefoldin and the apical domain of CCT4 in TRiC that allows prefoldin to pivot into the chamber.11 Prefoldin adopts a compact conformation in the less engaged TRiC contact, where the two substrate binding chambers are not aligned, but shifts to an extended conformation when the prefoldin- TRiC chambers become aligned, allowing for substrate transfer (Figures 2H and 2I, S2F, and S2G). This suggests prefoldin initially binds TRiC in the compact, substrate- bound conformation, but then TRiC interactions promote the extended prefoldin state to facilitate substrate release into the chaperonin chamber.

# The ternary complex of prefoldin:  $\beta$ -tubulin:TRiC in the open conformation

To visualize the substrate handoff from prefoldin to TRiC, we added prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin to purified TRiC and studied the ternary complex by cryo- EM (Figures 3A and S3A- S3D; Table S1). The prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin:TRiC complex showed the chamber of prefoldin fully aligned with that of TRiC through subunit specific contacts (Figure 3B). We observed a significant extra density inside the inter- ring space formed at the TRiC equatorial region not observed in the absence of substrate (Figures 3B- 3D).11 The prefoldin tentacles extend into the TRiC chamber. Strikingly, the PFD6 coiled coil made a clear connection to the substrate- dependent density in the inter- ring space (Figure 3C). The prefoldin in this TRiC complex is in the open extended conformation, suggesting TRiC binding reduces its affinity for the bound substrate. Indeed, no significant substrate density is observed inside the prefoldin chamber, despite the substantial extra density observed between the two TRiC rings. The oval- shaped substrate- induced extra- density is asymmetrically located within the inter- ring TRiC chamber, close to subunits CCT8, 6, and 3. Of note, we also observe clear connections between this density and the N- terminal tails of CCT5 and 7, which are normally not resolved in open TRiC structures (Figure 3D).

To further assess the origin of the extra density, we prepared a TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin complex generated without prefoldin and carried out cryo- EM analyses of both substrate- free apo- TRiC and TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin. Only the  $\beta$ - tubulin- containing TRiC has density in the central inter- ring region, while no notable density is

observed in substrate- free apo- TRiC (Figure 3E). The substrate- dependent density is located within an inter- ring chamber created by the equatorial domains of CCTs protruding into the central axis, forming a  $\sim 6 \text{nm}$  open cap covering a  $\sim 9 \times 5 \text{nm}$  globular inner space (Figure 3E). However, extensive focused 3D classification on the substrate- dependent extra density failed to discern any folded domain or secondary structure. While the presence of substrate- dependent density indicates the formation of a compact state, this structural uncertainty suggests heterogeneity in either the folding state or the positioning of  $\beta$ - tubulin within this region of the open TriC chamber.

We used XL- MS to further characterize the contacts of  $\beta$ - tubulin with prefoldin and TRiC within the ternary complex and in the binary TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin complex (Figures 3E and S2A; Table S2). TRiC addition to prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin led to a near complete loss of  $\beta$ - tubulin's XL to prefoldin and to the appearance of extensive XL to TRiC, consistent with substrate transfer between these chaperones (Figure 3F). The ternary complex only had one  $\beta$ - tubulin XL to PFD1 and one  $\beta$ - tubulin XL to the N terminus of PFD6 (Figure 3E). We also observed multiple PFD6 XL to the tails of CCT1 and CCT2 in the equatorial region of TRiC (Figures S3E and S3F). Together, these XL- MS observations support the structural data showing PFD6 inserting into the TRiC chamber placing the tip of the PFD6 tentacle proximal to the substrate- dependent density. Importantly, XL- MS also indicated extensive contacts between  $\beta$ - tubulin and the N- and C- terminal tails extending from the equatorial domains of CCT subunits into the chamber (Figures 3F and 3G). These XL- MS findings also agree with the cryo- EM maps showing the substrate localizes to the inter- ring chamber region in close proximity to the disordered N- and C- terminal CCT tails. XL between  $\beta$ - tubulin and the CCT apical domains were observed in the TRiC  $\beta$ - tubulin complex generated without prefoldin but not in the prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin:TRiC ternary sample.16,34 We did not observe notable substrate density at the similar contour level in the apical domain regions of TRiC. Perhaps the substrate interactions with apical domains are too dynamic to be clearly observed, or alternatively, apical contacts serve in the initial capture of substrate for subsequent engagement with the CCT tails. The ternary complex with prefoldin may thus reflect the substrate state after transfer to the inter- ring chamber.

While TRiC has been considered as a two- chamber folding system, our data suggest the existence of a third chamber that holds the substrate in open TRiC. Theoretically, the third interring chamber provides enough space for  $\sim 50 \text{kDa}$  protein, but it is most likely that both the substrate and the CCT tails contribute to the observed substrate- dependent density in our maps. Both TRiC and prefoldin contain long intrinsically disordered N- and C- terminal tails; the CCT tails projecting into this chamber comprise  $\sim 35.5 \text{kDa}$  of protein mass (schematized in Figure 3G). The observed substrate- dependent density within TRiC, together with the increased substrate protection from PK, both indicate the substrate becomes compacted upon TRiC binding, without leading to any stable domain formation. The unstructured CCT tails contacting  $\beta$ - tubulin in this region of the open inter- ring TRiC chamber contain both polar and hydrophobic character (Figures 3G and 3H). We speculate that these disordered tails function as a tethered solvent that maintains the unfolded polypeptide in a conformationally dynamic coacervate state, thus preventing the formation of trapped intermediates. This may stabilize  $\beta$ - tubulin folding intermediates in a folding- competent state by interactions with CCT tails in the open chaperonin conformation (Figures 3H and 3I).

# Cryo-EM identifies  $\beta$ -tubulin folding intermediates within the ATP-closed TRiC chamber

To examine the next step of the  $\beta$ - tubulin folding cycle (Figure 4A), we incubated the TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin complex with ATP- AIx to stabilize the closed conformation and examined  $\beta$ - tubulin folding in the chamber by cryo- EM. Following incubation with ATP- AIx, we observed open and closed TRiC states containing  $\beta$ - tubulin- dependent density (Figure 4A). As expected, the  $3.8 \text{\AA}$  open TRiC state contains the  $\beta$ - tubulin- dependent density in the inter- ring space (Figures 4, S4A, and S4B; Table S1). In contrast, the closed TRiC conformation contains the substrate density in the apical region within one of the chambers (Figure 4A, right). The repositioned  $\beta$ - tubulin in the  $2.8 \text{\AA}$  resolution closed TRiC density map had well- defined secondary structural element features (Figure 4A). Additionally, most of the CCT N- and C- terminal tails could be traced in the closed conformation but not in the open conformation.

In the initial overall map of closed TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin, we visualized partially folded  $\beta$ - tubulin with varying resolution, suggesting compositional and conformational heterogeneity. 3D classification focusing on the  $\beta$ - tubulin density revealed four distinct conformations of  $\beta$ - tubulin with structurally resolvable domains. The TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin conformations were reconstructed to resolutions ranging from  $2.9 \text{\AA}$  to  $3.6 \text{\AA}$  (Figures 4B and S4C- S4E) allowing us to build models of each TRiC- bound state (Figure 4C). In all four maps, the resolvable densities corresponded to native tubulin domains with well- resolved  $\alpha$  helices and  $\beta$  strands (Figures 4B and 4C; Video S1). The four  $\beta$ - tubulin structures are aligned along an axis of increased domain formation, suggesting  $\beta$ - tubulin is progressively folded in the TRiC chamber. We also observed clear density for the negatively charged C- terminal  $\beta$ - tubulin E- hook tail (Figures 4D and S5A), which is flexible in native tubulin. To assess the resolvability of our densities, we used a per- residue Q- score profile in a sliding window of 10

residues35 (Figure S4F). In agreement with their estimated resolution, we obtained consistently high Q- scores for the folded regions demonstrating the high resolvability of structural elements. In contrast, the poorly resolved segments have low Q- scores, suggestive of unfolded or conformationally dynamic regions. These conformations, designated states I- IV, reveal progressively folded  $\beta$  - tubulin inside closed TRiC, with state IV corresponding to fully folded  $\beta$  - tubulin (Video S1).

residues35 (Figure S4F). In agreement with their estimated resolution, we obtained consistently high Q- scores for the folded regions demonstrating the high resolvability of structural elements. In contrast, the poorly resolved segments have low Q- scores, suggestive of unfolded or conformationally dynamic regions. These conformations, designated states I- IV, reveal progressively folded  $\beta$ - tubulin inside closed TRiC, with state IV corresponding to fully folded  $\beta$ - tubulin (Video S1).The well- resolved residues in states I- IV map to specific domains formed by discontinuous sequences suggestive of domain- wise folding of  $\beta$ - tubulin (Figures 4D and 4E). The least- folded intermediate, state I, contains the folded N- terminal  $\beta$ - tubulin domain (residues 1- 170) (Figure 4E) with the exposed surface contacting the inner wall of CCT6- CCT8 (Figure 4C) and the C- terminal  $\beta$ - tubulin E- hook (residue 438- 444) bound to a pocket between CCT1 and CCT4 (Figure S5A). State II contains the resolved regions of state I as well as resolvable discontinuous sequence elements corresponding to the folded C- terminal domain (C domain) of  $\beta$ - tubulin, spanning residues 171- 203 and 263- 267 and C- terminal helices 372- 426 (Figures 4D and 4E). The folded C- terminal domain also binds the inner wall of TRiC, contacting residues of subunits CCT1 and CCT3 (Figure 4C). State III also contained the folded N- and C- terminal domains observed in state II as well as the discontinuous resolvable sequence elements corresponding to the folded helical core domain, spanning residues 204- 262, 268- 272, and 366- 371 (Figures 4D and 4E). Finally, state IV resembles state III but also contains the folded middle M domain, composed of residues 273- 365. Folding of this last M domain completes formation of a fully native  $\beta$ - tubulin monomer (Figures 4D and 4E). Though the TRiC- bound  $\beta$ - tubulin states exhibit C-  $\alpha$  backbone variation in certain loop regions, the folded secondary structural elements in all four states are almost identical to the structure of native  $\beta$ - tubulin (PDB: 6I2)36 (Figure S4G). The C- terminal E- hook tail of  $\beta$ - tubulin was clearly traceable in all four states nestled in a pocket formed by CCT1 and CCT4 (Figure S5A). These four structural states of  $\beta$ - tubulin within the chamber of TRiC suggest a sequential folding pathway where discontinuous sequence elements fold into specific native- like domains in close association with the inner chaperonin chamber, culminating in the native state (Figure 4E).

# Domain-specific CCT contacts spatially orient and restrain  $\beta$  -tubulin within the TRiC chamber

Upon ATP- driven encapsulation, the inner TRiC wall engages in domain- specific contacts with all four  $\beta$  - tubulin intermediates.

The extent of electrostatic interactions with the inner TRiC chamber increases from the less- folded to more- folded  $\beta$  - tubulin intermediates (Figure 5B; Video S2). This suggests a different mechanism to bacterial chaperonin GroEL- ES, which promotes substrate folding by releasing encapsulated polypeptides into their central hydrophilic chamber,2 often termed an "Anfinsen cage."37

We next examined in detail the interactions between  $\beta$  - tubulin and the TRiC chamber in each state. In all four  $\beta$  - tubulin intermediates, negatively charged residues exposed by folded N- terminal domain contacts specific positively charged residues in CCT6 and CCT8, while the negatively charged, normally unstructured, C- terminal E- hook tail of  $\beta$  - tubulin contacts a positively charged pocket at the interface of CCT1 and CCT4 (Figures 5B and S5A; Movie S2). The folded C- terminal  $\beta$  - tubulin domain in states II- IV also engages in electrostatic contacts with positively charged residues in CCT1 and CCT3. These electrostatic contacts between the folded N- and C- terminal domains and TRiC persist even once  $\beta$  - tubulin reaches the fully folded state (Figure 5A).

Previous analysis recognized that the TRiC inner chamber contains an asymmetric charge distribution, with a strong positively charged inner surface contributed by subunits CCT1/3/6/ 8 and a strong negatively charged inner surface contributed by CCT2/4/5/715 (Figure 5C). Of note, these charged surface patches are only formed upon lid closure following ATP hydrolysis (Figure 5C). The  $\beta$  - tubulin electrostatic interactions with the positively charged surface of TRiC segregate  $\beta$  - tubulin to one side of the TRiC chamber via contacts present in all folding intermediates, while the polypeptide regions folded only in states III and IV extend into the chamber cavity (Figures 4B and S5B), suggesting additional TRiC regions contribute to  $\beta$  - tubulin folding.

We next examined the specific contacts between the CCT subunits and each  $\beta$  - tubulin folding intermediate (Figures 5D5I). In the folded  $\beta$  - tubulin N domain (blue in Figures 5D and 5E), residues on the N terminus, H2, H3, H4, and loops H1- S2, H3- S4, and H4- S5 form salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with residues on CCT6 and CCT8 (Figures 5D and 5E).Within the folded C domain green in Figures 5F and 5G),H11 and H12 are anchored to CCT1 and CCT3 by additional salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Figure 4E).Our analysis also revealed specific contacts between  $\beta$  - tubulin and tails of CCT6 and CCT2, in addition to the previously highlighted E- hook tail of  $\beta$  - tubulin (Figures 5H and S5B).Remarkably, both the E- hook and the CCT tails are normally disordered, indicating that formation of the TRiC:  $\beta$  - tubulin complex promotes stabilization of these

flexible regions. The negatively charged E- hook of  $\beta$  - tubulin is nestled into a positively charged pocket at the interface of CCT1 and CCT4 (Figures 5H and S5A).The CCT6 C- terminal tail is proximal to the  $\beta$  - tubulin T5 loop in the C domain, which is part of the GTP binding pocket (Figure 5Hi). Since the T5 loop forms a possible hydrogen bond to GTP, it is possible that the CCT6 tail facilitates formation of the tubulin GTP binding pocket. Indeed, we observe nucleotide density in state Ill of  $\beta$  - tubulin (Figure 5H).

The regions corresponding to the core and M domains extend into the center of the TRiC chamber without any appreciable interactions with the inner wall. Closer examination reveals that TRiC contacts the core and M domains via the C- terminal tail of CCT2 in all the observed  $\beta$  - tubulin folding states (Figures 5Hii and S5B).In states I and II, the C terminus of CCT2 interacts with unfolded core/M domain density, while in states III and IV, the CCT2 tail engages the N and M loops in the taxol binding site38 as the core and M domains form sequentially during folding (Figure S5B). This suggests the C- terminal tail of CCT2 interacts with and assists the folding of the core and M domains of  $\beta$  - tubulin within the lumen of the chamber. Interestingly, although the flexible CCT2 C tail is poorly resolved in substrate- free closed TRiC chamber, we observe at a lower threshold an association between the vicinal C- terminal tails of CCT1 and CCT2, which extend together into the chamber (Figure S5E). Consistent with this observation, the C- terminal tail of CCT1 is negatively charged and that of CCT2 is positively charged and possesses several prolines that may rigidify this flexible region. It is interesting to speculate that the C termini of CCT1- CCT2 jointly act as a fulcrum that, upon lid closure, facilitates the repositioning of  $\beta$  - tubulin to the vicinity of the CCT1- CCT3- CCT6- CCT8 hemisphere.

These structures indicate that all the  $\beta$  - tubulin folding intermediates interact with closed TRiC through a combination of more rigid and complementary electrostatic interactions with the chamber wall and flexible interactions with the CCT tails (Figure 5l). Importantly, the negatively charged surface character of the N- and C- terminal domains is conserved across  $\alpha$ $\beta$  - and  $\gamma$  - tubulins (Figure S5F), suggesting a similar mode of TRiC- facilitated folding. Emphasizing the importance of these contacts for tubulin folding, the residues within the TRiC chamber making both electrostatic inner chamber contacts and tail contacts with  $\beta$  - tubulin are highly conserved (Figure S5G).It thus appears that TRiC does not release the  $\beta$  - tubulin polypep

tide into the closed chamber for folding. Instead, the TRiC chamber binds  $\beta$  - tubulin throughout the folding process. The TRiC contacts directly restrain and orient the N domain and C- terminal tail of  $\beta$  - tubulin to one hemisphere in the chamber, thus limiting the folding polypeptide's degree of freedom and preventing its free rotation in the chamber.

TRiC interactions shaping the tubulin folding landscape Our four cryo- EM structures of progressively folded  $\beta$  - tubulin (Figure 5) demonstrate the involvement of different CCT subunits at different folding intermediates via specific chemical interactions and the unexpected roles of the intrinsically disordered CCT tails guiding the unstructured domains of  $\beta$  - tubulin toward the fully folded structure (Figure 6A). A pathway invoking early folding of the N- terminal  $\beta$  - tubulin domain, which is well resolved in all four TRiC- bound folding intermediates, resonates with the PK- sensitivity assays of the folding reaction, which indicate early protection of an N- terminal domain but rapid digestion of the C terminus until completion of full- length  $\beta$  - tubulin folding (Figures S1G- S1l).

Our results suggest how TRiC- directed  $\beta$  - tubulin folding circumvents the challenges posed by its complex topology and aggregation- prone  $\beta$  sheets. The progressively folded intermediates observed in the chamber form domains that are discontinuous in sequence but orchestrate the continuous formation of a hydrophobic  $\beta$  sheet running the length of the  $\beta$  - tubulin structure (Figure 6B); Movie S3).Anchoring the surface of the folded N and C domains to the TRiC chamber wall not only establishes the native topology but also positions the growing folding intermediates so that their hydrophobic core extends toward the interior of the chamber (Figure 6Bii). Comparing states I through IV, each increasingly folded intermediate adds another  $\beta$  strand layer to the exposed hydrophobic core, likely priming it for the next folding step. Importantly, each intermediate also incorporates the helices above and below the growing  $\beta$  sheet, thus protecting its edges and reducing the potential for off- pathway interactions. In state I, the folded N domain exposes the hydrophobic strands S4 and S5. Completion of the Rossman fold in state II allows helices H5, H11, and H12 to cover the newly incorporated strands S6 and S7.39 Formation of the core domain in state Ill reduces a change in direction between strands S7 and S10, mediated by helix H7. The CCT2 tail may participate in this step, as it interacts with this region of the core domain. The last folding step to reach native  $\beta$  - tubulin involved completion of the  $\beta$  sheet by

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/9235d407-7ed2-4717-8282-34d61442e867/a6fee1208382d7f402476a7539ff75edd3926330e0f2aa2a3167680ad0963c5d.jpg)

addition of sheets S8- S10 and positioning of helices H7, H9, and H10 to cover the hydrophobic core of tubulin. We propose that these TRiC interactions shape the tubulin folding landscape to establish the native topology and preclude the formation of trapped folding intermediates, thereby reducing the frustration of the folding landscape.

# TRiC action in folding pathway in the context of tubulin evolution

While eukaryotic tubulin folding exhibits an obligate requirement for TRiC, its prokaryotic homolog FtsZ can spontaneously fold without chaperones.40,41 Both proteins share a similar overall topology with other superfamily members in prokaryotes and archaea, including the overall domain organization and the extended core  $\beta$  sheet (Figures 6C, S6A, and S6B).40,42- 44 However, eukaryotic tubulins are distinguished by additional features integral to their unique function and regulation, including remodeling of GTP affinity and hydrolysis kinetics, the ability to engage in microtubule lateral contacts, and binding microtubule- associated proteins (MAPs).40,45- 47 These tubulin functions are accompanied by insertions in the H1- S2 loop and two negatively charged helices, H11 and H12; by the presence of the E- hook tail; by the remodeling of the residues contacting GTP; and by extensive changes to the C domain leading to an increase in hydrophobic interdomain interfaces40,42- 44 (highlighted in Figure 6C for 612l 36 vs 1FSZ,48 S6C). Eukaryotic tubulins are also distinguished by the strongly negative surface charge on the folded N and C domains as well as a negatively charged C- terminal E- hook tail. We hypothesize these features of eukaryotic tubulins hinder their ability to fold spontaneously or with simpler chaperone systems. Remarkably, the tubulin- specific insertions correspond to the sites of TRiC binding during folding in the closed chamber, suggesting their incorporation into ancestral tubulin was accompanied by a need for specialized folding assistance (Figure 6D).

This hypothesis is supported by close examination of how TRiC mediates formation of the unique N- C domain interface in  $\beta$  - tubulin (Figures 6E and S6D). The T3 loop, which participates in the folded  $\beta$  - tubulin N- C interdomain interface, shifts between two alternative conformations in the TRiC- bound  $\beta$  - tubulin folding intermediates, with  $10\dot{\mathsf{A}}\mathsf{C} - \alpha$  variation (Figures S4G and S5C; Video S4). Our maps' good Q- score resolve the bulky side chains in the T3 loop, such as H105 and Y106, allowing us to trace the density of T3 in the folding intermediates (Figure S6D). The H1- S2 loop forms charged and hydrogen- bonded interactions with the TRiC chamber, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the inserted  $\beta$  - tubulin loops by the TRiC chamber (Figures 4E and 6D). In state I, the T3 loop, resolved at residues 100- 109, adopts an extended conformation directed by contacts with E202 of CCT3 and D86 of CCT6 (Figure S5C). In state

II, a decrease in resolvability of residues 96- 106 in T3 (Figure S5C) suggests the loop changes conformation upon folding of the C domain. In states III and IV, the T3 loop becomes well resolved due to its stabilization by interaction with the folded C domain, adopting the native  $\beta$  - tubulin conformation (PDB: 6I21)66 (Figures S4G and S5C). Accordingly, N99 of T3 serves in GTP  $\gamma$  - phosphate sensing, while hydrophobic T3 residues including W101 are embedded in the hydrophobic interface between the N and C domains (Figure 6C). Folding of the core helix domain completes the GTP binding pocket by contributing the H6- H7, consistent with the nucleotide density in the GTP binding pocket observed in states III and IV (Figures 5D, 6E, and S5C). Thus, TRiC contacts keep the T3 loop in an extended conformation when the C domain is not folded, and these contacts are released to allow the native conformation at the interdomain interface upon C domain folding.

# DISCUSSION

Why some proteins have an obligate requirement for TRiC assistance has long been enigmatic. We combined XL- MS and cryo- EM to elucidate the pathway delivering unstructured  $\beta$  - tubulin from PFD to the TRiC chamber where it folds through specific contacts between the substrate and the CCT subunits (Figure 7A). We determined near- atomic- resolution structures of multiple stable folding intermediates of  $\beta$  - tubulin engaged in specific interactions with various CCT subunits including the intrinsically disordered termini. Our data suggest that these interactions guide tubulin to the native state through stepwise formation of partially folded intermediates (Figure 7B). Throughout this pathway, the substrate is not released into the central TRiC chamber, unlike what is observed with GroEL- ES, but instead remains anchored through specific contacts with the CCT wall and the C tails. These findings establish that, for tubulin, and perhaps other TRiC substrates, the folding pathway is guided by explicit interactions with the inner TRiC chamber.

Of note, a recent study published during the review process. (NSMB, doi: 10.1038/s41594- 022- 00755- 1) reports that TRiC immunoprecipitated from a cell lysate contains a partially folded tubulin molecule within the closed chamber in the same location we observed for our averaged initial TRiC- ATP- tubulin folding intermediate in Figure 4A. It is tempting to speculate that the tubulin contained within TRiC isolated from cells became associated during the process of biogenesis and thus represents the ensemble states of biologically meaningful folding intermediates. While further experiments should probe how tubulin folds in vivo following translation, these data suggest our reconstituted folding reaction recapitulates the intermediates populated during biological folding of tubulin.

# Beyond Anfinsen: The TRiC chamber shapes folding intermediates

Beyond Anfinsen: The TRiC chamber shapes folding intermediatesPrefoldin- bound  $\beta$ - tubulin is delivered to the open TRiC chamber, where interactions with the disordered CCT tails generates a compact entity without discernible folded elements. We speculate the disordered tails confined within the TRiC chamber act as a tethered solvent to maintain the fluidity of the substrate promoting a dynamic yet compacted state. The liquid- like nature of such a coacervate may prevent the formation of non- productive or trapped intermediates, priming the substrate for productive folding upon chamber closure (Figure 7A). Upon ATP- dependent chamber closure, the substrate repositions from the equatorial chamber into one of the ring- enclosed folding chambers (Figure 7B). The ATP- closed TRiC chamber directs the stepwise formation of  $\beta$ - tubulin folding intermediates that remain bound to specific regions in the chamber through electrostatic and H- bond interactions between  $\beta$ - tubulin and the TRiC chamber. These contacts establish the necessary native topology for  $\beta$ - tubulin and help orchestrate a hydrophobic collapse to then drive sequential folding of the  $\beta$ - tubulin domains. One feature of the discontinuous formation of  $\beta$ - tubulin domains in this folding pathway is the unidirectional assembly of the  $\beta$  sheet spanning the entire hydrophobic core in folded  $\beta$ - tubulin. These TRiC contacts appear to direct  $\beta$ - tubulin folding through sequential domain formation without releasing the substrate into the chamber. This contrasts to the mechanism of chaperonin GroEL- ES, which releases polypeptides into an inner chamber that provides a unique confined environment for folding.49- 53 The fact that contacts with the closed TRiC chamber guide multiple steps in  $\beta$ - tubulin folding raises doubts on the universality of Anfinsen's principle.

The concept of TRiC directing the folding pathway is illustrated by the notable structural change in the T3 loop of  $\beta$ - tubulin between states I and II. TRiC keeps the T3- loop in an extended conformation through contacts with the inner wall until the C- terminal domain folds through association with the TRiC wall, then the T3 loop is released from the chamber wall to become nestled at the N- C domain interface. The T3 loop acts as a folding switch to control sequential folding of the GTP binding pocket after completion of the N- C domain interface (Figure 6E). Thus, TRiC binding to the T3 loop ensures the proper folding of the C domain, establishing the overall fold topology of  $\beta$ - tubulin and allowing the hydrophobic core of the M and core domains to fold. Perhaps GTP binding to the incipient nucleotide pocket drives these subsequent steps, as observed for bacterial tubulin FtsZ (Figure 6C), where GTP binding is a limiting step during spontaneous refolding.54 The TRiC:  $\beta$ - tubulin contacts directly orchestrate the progression of events needed to form the GTP binding pocket by sequential positioning of the nucleotide sensing T3 loop to form the N- C domain interface, which are not conserved in FtsZ (Figures 6C- 6E). Consistent with this, tubulin mutations in the N- C domain interface affect  $\beta$ - tubulin folding and release from TRiC55 (Figure S6E). While TRiC appears to direct the folding landscape through formation of specific intermediates (Figure 7B), the tubulin- CCT contacts may also disfavor formation of kinetically trapped states (Figure 7C).

# Insights into evolution of eukaryotic proteins that cannot fold without TRiC

It is intriguing to speculate why and how this complex TRiCtubulin requirement evolved from simpler ancestral proteins like FtsZ, which can refold without assistance. Compared with FtsZ, tubulin contains a series of structural changes that serve to enable functional interactions at the lateral interface of protofilaments and binding of microtubule- associated proteins (MAPs) and kinosin 46,47,56 while these additional elements support the novel properties of eukaryotic tubulin, they appear to impair spontaneous folding,56 perhaps leading to off- pathway or kinetically trapped intermediates (Figure 7C). Strikingly, the major sites of  $\beta$  - tubulin interaction with the TRiC- chamber are in these eukaryote- specific regions.We propose these eukaryotic- specific changes in tubulin evolved to exploit the hetero- oligomeric and asymmetric nature of TRiC to circumvent the inherent challenges they pose to the folding pathway.

The finding that tubulin folding is closely directed by TRiC chamber interactions opens new perspectives to understand the role of TRiC in eukaryotic protein evolution. The striking expansion of TRiC subunits directs the subunit- specific diversification of substrate binding sites, ATP affinity, and chamber properties, all of which contribute to its unique ability to fold some eukaryotic proteins. In turn, these may underlie their obligate requirement for TRiC to fold. Given that TRiC facilitates folding of  $\sim 10\%$  of the proteome, it is likely that some proteins employ TRiC like an Anfinsen cage, similar to GroEL- ES, to prevent aggregation and smooth the folding landscape.57 Indeed, the now more limited space present in the chamber upon ATP- induced lid closure may restrain the possible orientations or conformations of the encapsulated polypeptide, significantly reducing the structural ensembles available to the substrate within the chamber of closed TRiC. Other proteins may additionally exploit other evolved features of the TRiC hetero- oligomer for which the diverse apical domain sequence and structure can provide substrate interaction specificity to promote a specific polypeptide binding topology.12,16,19,20 Also, some substrates may interact distinctly with specific regions in the chamber.58 Our finding that the eukaryote- specific tubulin insertions evolved surface- exposed motifs that bind specific regions in the TRiC chamber to shape the folding pathway provides an intriguing clue as to how some eukaryotic proteins evolved to exploit the unique properties of TRiC to acquire new functionalities that would otherwise impede their correct folding.

# Limitations of the study

Limitations of the studyA TRiC- directed  $\beta$ - tubulin folding pathway that progresses from less folded to more folded states is here derived from snapshot images at single- equilibrium condition. Time- resolved kinetic analyses of tubulin folding, such as time- resolved H- D exchange and spectroscopic approaches are needed to validate and extend this pathway. The observation that the CCT intrinsically disordered tails promote TRiC- mediated folding resonates with findings for other chaperones that also use disordered domains for function.59,60 Extending the idea that regions of intrinsic disorder promote folding will open new perspectives on what constitutes a chaperone and revise the classic notion that

chaperones only function through domains that recognize non- native proteins through hydrophobic surfaces.

# Protein expression and purification

# TRiC alone

High Five insect cells (1 L) were co- infected with rBVs encoding his- tagged TRiC with CCT1 tagged with GFP. Cells were incubated at  $27^{\circ}C$  for  $\sim 72h$  pelleted by centrifugation at  $500\times g$  for  $10\min$  , and resuspended in TRiC lysis buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4,  $50~\mathrm{mM}$  NaCl,  $20~\mathrm{mM}$  imidazole,  $10\%$  glycerol,  $5\mathrm{mM}$  PMSF) supplemented with benzonase (Sigma- Aldrich- Aldrich, E1014) (1,000 units) and a protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche). Cells were lysed using dounce homogenization and debris was cleared by ultracentrifugation at  $50,000\times g$  at  $4^{\circ}C$  for  $40\min$  .

Samples were brought to  $37^{\circ}C$  and  $1\mathrm{mM}$  ATP/GTP was added to the Tubulin dimer control, Prefoldin:tubulin sample, TRiC:Prefoldin:tubulin sample  $(+\mathsf{ATP / GTP})$  , and TRiC:Prefoldin:tubulin sample  $(+\mathsf{ATP / GTP - AIFx})$  . After 5 min, NaF to  $1\mathrm{mM}$  and  $A1N O_{3}$  to  $6\mathrm{mM}$  was added to the TRiC:Prefoldin:tubulin sample  $(+\mathsf{ATP / GTP - }$  AIFx). After  $30\min$  samples were brought to room temperature.  $15\mu L$  was removed from each sample for zero- minute time points, and digestion was initiated by addition of proteinase K to a final concentration of  $2ng / \mu L$  . Timepoints were taken at 2, 4, 8 and  $16\min$  by adding  $15\mu L$  sample to  $2\mu L$  of PMSF, followed by  $6\mu L$  4XPSB. Samples were analyzed by SDS- PAGE followed by immunoblot with indicated antibodies. For assays with denatured Tubulin, chaperones were diluted to  $0.25\mu M$  . Bovine Tubulin at a concentration of  $12.5\mu M$  was denatured in  $6M$  GuHCl,  $100~\mathrm{mM}$  HEPES pH 7.4,  $1\mathrm{mM}$  DTT, and chaperone mixes were used to dilute denatured Tubulin 1:100 for a final concentration of  $0.125\mu M$  .

# Crosslinking-mass spectrometry

For hPrefoldin:  $\beta$  - tubulin with hTRiC samples, TRiC was brought to  $1\mu M$  and Prefoldin to  $2\mu M$  hPrefoldin:  $\alpha /\beta$  - tubulin alone was prepared at  $5\mu M$  ,hTRiC:  $\beta$  - tubulin alone was prepared at  $1\mu M$  . All samples were prepared in  $50~\mathrm{mM}$  HEPES pH 7.4,  $50~\mathrm{mM}$  NaCl and  $1\mathrm{mM}$  DTT. TRiC samples were incubated at  $37^{\circ}C$  for  $30\min$  with nucleotide to reach equilibrium/closed state. Fresh DSS crosslinker dissolved in DMsO was added to a final concentration of  $1\mathrm{mM}$  , TRiC samples were incubated at  $37^{\circ}C$  for  $1h$  with crosslinker, hPrefoldin:  $\alpha /\beta$  - tubulin alone was incubated at room temperature for  $1h$  at room temperature. Crosslinking was quenched by incubation for  $30\min$  after addition of  $1M$  Tris pH 7.4 to a final concentration of  $100~\mathrm{mM}$  . Crosslinked samples processing steps included

reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues with tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine and iodoacetamide, respectively, sequential digestion with endoprotease Lys- C (Wako) and trypsin (Promega), clean- up using solid- phase extraction (Waters Sep- Pak tC18 cartridges) and fractionation of the purified digests by size exclusion chromatography (SEC; GE Superdex Peptide PC  $3.2 / 300$ ).<sup>61</sup>

Liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) was performed on an Easy nLC- 1200 HPLC system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (both ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were separated by reversed- phase chromatography on an Acclaim PepMap RLSC C18 column (250 mm x 75 μm, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase gradient was 11–40% B in 60 min, with mobile phases A = water/acetonitrile/formic acid (98:2:0.15, v/v/v) and B = acetonitrile/water/formic acid (80:20:0.15, v/v/v). MS/MS data were acquired in the data- dependent acquisition top speed mode with a cycle time of 3 s. Precursor and fragment ion spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at 120,000 and 30,000 resolution, respectively. Precursor ions with a charge state of +3 to +7 were fragmented in the linear ion trap at a normalized collision energy of 35%. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30 s after one sequencing event.

MS/MS spectra were analyzed using xQuest, version 2.1.5 (available from https://gitlab.ethz.ch/leitner_lab/xquest_xprophet). The database contained the entries of all human TRiC and prefoldin subunits, human tubulin beta (TBB5_HUMAN), and insect tubulins as possible contaminants. No other contaminant proteins were observed at relevant levels. Search parameters for xQuest included: enzyme = trypsin, maximum number of missed cleavages = 2, carbamidomethylation of Cys as fixed modification, oxidation of Met as variable modification, Lys and protein N terminus as cross- linking sites, mass error tolerances of ±15 ppm at the MS1 level and ±20 ppm at the MS2 level. Search results were further filtered with stricter mass tolerances depending on the dataset, and identifications were required to have an xQuest delta score <0.9, a TIC score >0.1, and a minimum of four bond cleavages overall or three consecutive bond cleavages per peptide. A parallel search against the reversed and shuffled sequences of the database entries revealed no decoy hits fulfilling the search and filter criteria, suggesting the false discovery rate is close to 0% for the selected score thresholds. XLs are shown in Table S2. Mapping of XLs was performed using xiVIEW.<sup>62</sup>

# Native Mass spectrometry

Prefoldin and Prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin were diluted 20- fold from storage buffer into 250 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, before completing buffer exchange using 10 xDa MWCO Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma). Final concentrations were estimated by UV absorbance to be between 10 and 20  $\mu$ M Prefoldin. Native mass spectra were then recorded within several hours, during which proteins were kept on ice. Samples were injected using borseilicate emitters (Thermo Fisher Scientific E336) into a QExactive Plus EMR orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The quadrupole was set to transmit m/z range 1,000 to 10,000. Resolution was 17,500 at 200 m/z for a transient time of 64 ms. Injection time was 50 ms and automatic gain control was off. The capillary voltage was 1.2 kV and S- lens RF was 100. Microscans were grouped sequentially in sets of 10. In- source activation was 50 V and activation in the higher- energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell was 20 V, based on values found to sharpen peaks without discernable complex dissociation. Pressure in the HCD cell (nitrogen) was 5e- 10 mbar. For transmission of Prefoldin, the injection flatapole was set to 20 V, the inter flatapole lens to 12 V, and the bent flatapole to 6 V; for Prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin transmission, these values were respectively 12, 10, and 3 V. Raw data were summed and visualized in XCalibur v4.1.31.9 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Initial deconvolution was performed using UniDec v3.1.0. <sup>73</sup> Masses were measured manually by minimizing error over different charge state assignments. Each charge state arising from Prefoldin and Prefoldin:  $\beta$ - tubulin was assigned to the open or compact conformation based on Gaussian peak envelopes. Raw signal intensities of each peak were recorded from XCalibur, summed within assigned conformations, and used to derive fractional occupancies. Conclusions based on native MS data were cross- validated by computing changes in solvent- accessible surface area for Prefoldin models.

Movies were aligned in  $5\times 5$  patches in MotionCor2, and CTF parameters were estimated with GCTF. After initial template- based picking of 1,621,636 particles, 2D classification was performed. After selection, 443,858 particles were used for 3D classification yielding 2 major classes. Prefoldin bound TRiC with 194,013 particles and non- bound TRiC with 249,845 particles. Using non- uniform refinement, prefoldin bound and non- bound TRiC was reconstructed at a resolution of  $3.9\mathring{A}$  and  $4.2\mathring{A}$  respectively. This analysis workflow is illustrated in Figure S3.

# TRiC:  $\beta$  -tubulin with ATP-AIFx

21,486 movies were aligned in  $5\times 5$  patches by MotionCor2 (v), and CTF parameters were estimated with CTFFIND (v 4.1). Particles picked with a template matching method were subject to multiple rounds of 2D classification followed by 3D classification. 819,553 particles in open state were used to reconstruct an open state TRiC:  $\beta$  - tubulin map to  $3.8\mathring{A}$  and 529,181 particles were used to obtain a  $2.7\mathring{A}$  C1 symmetry map. This analysis workflow is illustrated in Figure S4A.

# Compositional heterogeneity analysis of TRiC:  $\beta$  -tubulin with ATP-AIFx

529,181 particles of closed state are aligned to the C2 (D1) symmetry axis to obtain a  $2.5\mathring{A}$  consensus map of closed state TRiC- tubulin. For compositional analysis of tubulin in the TRiC chamber, the star file of the related particles was extended 2 times by religion_particle_symmetry_expand with D1 symmetry to cover the orientation for each of two rings in each particle. 3D focused classification of the tubulins was performed with a tubulin mask but without symmetry and orientational search. The identified tubulin occupied rings were thus traced back to the original double- ring TRiC particles for the tubulin occupancy analysis. This analysis workflow is illustrated in Figure S4A.

# Conformational heterogeneity analysis of TRiC:  $\beta$  -tubulin with ATP-AIFx

The tubulin occupied rings were further subject to focused classification for conformational heterogeneity analysis. In brief, a tubulin mask was applied to the related rings in multiple 3D classifications without orientational search, four tubulin intermediate conformations were identified and each conformation was further locally refined to high resolution. This analysis workflow is illustrated in Figure S4B.

# Model building

# Prefoldin:  $\beta$  -tubulin:TRiC

Model building started from previous Prefoldin:TRiC model (PDB: 6NR8).11 The initial model was fitted into the density map and manually refined in COOT.67 Then, the model was refined on the Namdinator server using MDFF68 and Phenix real space refinement default options.68 After few rounds, the model was further corrected using Phenix and COOT.69

# Copurified TRiC:  $\beta$  -tubulin under ATP-AIFx condition

The model of TRiC in the closed form (PDB: 7LUM) reference was rigidly fit into the closed state TRiC density by rigid body fitting with Fit in Map tool from Chimera v1.14. This fitted model was further refined with phenix.real_space refine in Phenix v1.18.1, ISOLDE v1.1.0. And refined models were inspected and adjusted in COOT. The model of tubulin (PDB: 6l2l)6 was rigidly fitted to each tubulin intermediate density, and manually adjusted by COOT and ISOLDE v1.1.0. All adjusted models were then refined using phenix.real_space_refine in Phenix.

All models were validated by Q- score55 and phenix. validation, cryoem.69 Difference maps showing the nucleotide density in TRiCtubulin closed state were calculated between the complex density map and the map calculated from the model of protein only, generated by phenix. real_diff map. The figures of the difference map were generated by Chimera with the same contour level 3 sigma. All other figures were generated by Chimera and ChimeraX.70

# PISA analysis

The interactions between TRiC and  $\beta$  - tubulin model in each state were calculated using the PISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ pdbe/pisa/).

# Logo plot generation

Residue conservation was compared across 393 mainly eukaryotic with some archaeal species (group II chaperonins) for residues predicted to make interactions by PISA. Plots were generated using EDlogo plot.71

# Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building

Multiple sequence alignments for tubulin and tubulin homologues (Data S1) were generated using the multiple sequence alignment tool T- coffee Espresso and visualized. $^{72}$  A phylogenetic tree of tubulin and tubulin homologs was made in MEGA X software. $^{74}$

# QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Statistical tests were carried out in Prism. Pie, bar charts, heat maps and scatterplots were produced using R and Prism. Gel and radiograph densitometry were done in ImageJ. ATPase data was plotted in Prism. Average XL distance for PFD- TRiC interXLs was calculated by mapping all interXLs in which both XL residues are resolved onto PDB: 6NR8 and averaging the distance. SEM was calculated by dividing the SD by the square root of the number of XLs.

# Figure S1. Purification systems and folding analysis for  $\alpha /\beta$ -tubulin, related to Figure 1

(A) Purification scheme for Prefoldin:tubulin and TRiC:  $\beta$ -tubulin 
(B) Purified TRiC:  $\beta$ -tubulin or  $\alpha$ -tubulin with SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE analysis, immunoblot confirms  $\beta$ -tubulin or  $\alpha$ -tubulin comigrates with TRiC in native gel. 
(C) Purified Prefoldin:tubulin ( $\beta$  or  $\alpha$ -tubulin) with SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE analysis, note faster migration of Prefoldin:tubulin relative to Prefoldin alone in native gel. 
(D)  $\alpha$ -tubulin folding assay.  $\alpha$ -tubulin co-expressed and copurified with Prefoldin comigrates on a native gel. In the absence of nucleotide  $\alpha$ -tubulin comigrates with TRiC, and addition of nucleotide (ATP/GTP) drives folding and partial release of  $\alpha$ -tubulin in the presence of TBCB. 
(E) Protease sensitivity assay (Proteinase K) of Prefoldin:tubulin samples; Fully folded  $\alpha /\beta$  Tubulin dimer is insensitive to PK digestion, while Prefoldin:tubulin samples show rapid degradation by SDS-PAGE visualized by Coomassie stain 
(i) or immunoblot 
(ii). 
(F) Protease sensitivity assay of Prefoldin:  $\alpha$ -tubulin folding by TRiC. Like  $\beta$ -tubulin,  $\alpha$ -tubulin bound to Prefoldin is protease sensitive, transfer to TRiC from Prefoldin causes a decrease in sensitivity, and addition of nucleotide drives folding resulting in limited protease sensitivity equivalent to  $\alpha$ -tubulin in a native  $\alpha /\beta$  Tubulin dimer. 
(G-1) Protease sensitivity assay to test if TRiC closure is providing protease protection with degradation assayed by both an N-terminal region polyclonal antibody, and a C-terminal (AA2) monoclonal antibody. After completion of  $\beta$ -tubulin folding by TRiC as assayed in 
(H), apyrase is added to reopen the lid TRiC complex, followed by incubation at the indicated times. PK protease sensitivity is assayed at indicated time points 
(I). No increase in protease sensitivity is observed immediately after 30 min apyrase addition, the 90 min incubation leads to a mild increase in sensitivity likely due to slow unfolding.

Open and compact states of Prefoldin and Prefoldin:  $\beta$ -tubulin are outlined in blue and red respectively, with outline widths proportional to relative abundances. These data show a shift in conformational equilibrium upon  $\beta$ -tubulin binding.

(Cell 185, 4770- 4787. e1- e8; December 8, 2022) We overlooked a related study that was published during the revision of the manuscript. This study visualized tubulin within immu. noprecipitated TRiC complexes using cryo- EM and found partial tubulin density within the TRiC chamber similar to what we observe in Figure 4A (Kelly et al, 2022). We have now acknowledged this study in the Discussion and have cited it accordingly. We apologize for any confusion this error may have caused.
