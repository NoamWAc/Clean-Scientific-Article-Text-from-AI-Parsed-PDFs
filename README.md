# Extract-Scientific-Articles-from-PDFs
Finding a way to extract just the actual scientific acticle (abstract, intro, methods, results, discussion) for easier consumption and/or management

* What does this project do?
  * This project is meant to help me (and others) who have access through their institute to paywalled scientific articles' PDFs but not to the clean text on the website. It will convert an article's PDF and extract only the scientifically important information, so we can have easier access to the raw scientific article and, say, have the text read to us as audio or otherwise manipulated in ways that can promote understanding.
* What kind of input data it expects and what kind out output the user might expect?
  * It will expect a scientific article PDF, and will output the desired chapters as text, possibly also with the figures and tables. Maybe even an AI-generated summary.
* The technicalities: How to download it, install the dependencies, run the tests, and run the project?
  * I don't know yet
