# Extract-Scientific-Articles-from-PDFs

## What does this project do?

This project is meant to help me (and others) who have access to full-text scientific article PDFs through their academic institution, but not to the clean, readable text that might be available on journal websites.

The tool will extract only the scientifically meaningful parts of a research article — the abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and optionally figure/table captions — from the PDF. This allows for easier consumption and post-processing, especially for people who prefer or need to read articles in different formats.

For example, the extracted text can be:
- Read aloud with a screen reader or text-to-speech software
- Reformatted with a different font or layout
- Used for quick skimming or note-taking
- Summarized automatically using AI (if possible)

The goal is to make dense scientific articles more accessible and manageable, without all the clutter of publisher footers, page numbers, or unrelated metadata.

## Why not just use AI summaries?

While large language models can generate impressive summaries (like most of this file's text!), they may omit important details or misinterpret nuanced information. By definition, a summary leaves out data — and as much as I've tried, AI tools (currently) can't reliably extract the exact text from a PDF. This project is designed to **extract and preserve** the full text of each article section, ensuring that users retain access to the original methods, results, and critical details. AI-based summaries may be included as an optional convenience, but they won't replace the actual content.

## What kind of input data it expects and what kind of output the user might expect?

**Input:**
- A PDF file of a scientific research article (ideally machine-readable, not scanned)

**Output:**
- A clean text file (or structured format like JSON) containing:
  - The article's title and abstract
  - Section-wise text (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.)
  - Figure/table captions (if possible)
  - (Optional) AI-generated summaries or bullet points for quick understanding

## The technicalities

At this stage, the technical implementation is still being explored. Broadly, the plan is to:

- Use an open-source Python library for reading and parsing PDFs (e.g., PyMuPDF or pdfminer)
- Apply basic text processing and pattern matching to detect scientific section headers
- Optionally integrate an AI model to generate summaries of the extracted content

The project will be structured as a simple command-line tool, but could eventually include a basic graphical interface or web app. I’ll finalize the technical details as the project develops.

## Why this project?

This tool solves a real problem I encounter while doing research — I often need to work with (due to paywalls) PDFs that are hard to read, manipulate, or convert. Copying and pasting from them has resulted in messy, broken text that’s very hard to follow. Having a way to extract just the meaningful scientific content would save time, reduce frustration, and open the door to useful transformations like changing fonts or listening to the article as audio.

This project could also be useful to others with similar needs — for accessibility, efficiency, or study support.
